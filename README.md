DNS over HTTPS over PiHole for Raspbian

This has been pulled from https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns-over-https/ and modified so that it can be run as a single script.

Before running the script 'sudo -v' may be needed to run to cache the password, depending on how your Pi is setup.

Run https://github.com/vanderblugen/PiDOH/blob/master/main.sh

Update DNS to point to the pi like the image shows
